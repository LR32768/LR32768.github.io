This is the homepage of Rui Lu (卢睿) from Tsinghua University.

Biography
======
I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Gao Huang](http://www.gaohuang.net/). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree from Yao Class, the Institute of Interdisciplinary Information Sciences. I was lucky to be advised by [Yang Yuan](http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~yuanyang/en.html) for my undergraduate thesis. I was also a visiting student at Berkeley BAIR Center in 2019 under the supervision of [Jitendra Malik](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/).

Research Interest
======
My research interests are broadly in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Reinforcement Learning. The main focus and ultimate goal of my research is to develop a principled theory for understanding deep learning's effectiveness, functionality, and limitations. I am also interested in designing better and faster learning algorithms/architectures.
