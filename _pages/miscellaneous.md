## My hobbies

I like playing Chinese chess, writing Chinese calligraphy, and reading. Sometimes write ancient Chinese poems (律诗). I was on the school debate team and won first place in the Beijing debate competition and third place in the world-cup debate competition. I do not play games too much, except for music games (Phigros RKS 15.5).

I am also a Tenor singer (T2) in the chorus team at Tsinghua University. My current vocal range is D2-E5 (keep updating). Like playing piano but not quite good at it.
