This is the homepage of Rui Lu (卢睿) from Tsinghua University. I will be on job market at Oct 2026! Please contact me if you are interested.

Biography
======
I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Gao Huang](http://www.gaohuang.net/). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree from Yao Class, the Institute of Interdisciplinary Information Sciences. I was lucky to be advised by [Yang Yuan](http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~yuanyang/en.html) for my undergraduate thesis. I was also a visiting student at Berkeley BAIR Center in 2019 under the supervision of [Jitendra Malik](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/) and visiting scholar at Princeton University in 2024 supervised by [Mengdi Wang](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/mengdi-wang).

Research Interest
======
My research interests are broadly in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Reinforcement Learning. In post-GPT era, I am also interested in developing LLMs to discover new knowledge that can give inspiration and insight to human. The main focus and ultimate goal of my research is to develop a principled theory for understanding deep learning's effectiveness, functionality, and limitations. I am also interested in designing better and faster learning algorithms/architectures.
